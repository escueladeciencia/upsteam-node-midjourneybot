# Midjourney Voter

**Midjourney Voter** is a simple bot for Discord developed in Node.js to run Art AI competitions based on Midjourney Bot.

Once installed and configured, it will capture all images produced by Midjourney and store them on an Airtable database.

Discord users will be able to vote Midjourney images reacting with this emoji (üòç).

Please, check a [live example](https://upsteam.es/midjourney) in action. The listing has been made with the nocode tool [Softr.io](https://www.softr.io/) embedded in Wordpress.

This tool has been designed for the spanish hackathon [Up! Steam](https://upsteam.es/), which is focused on encouraging teaching-learning STEAM disciplines (Science, Technology, Arts, Engineering and Mathematics) to 10-16yo kids in Comunidad Valenciana (Spain).
